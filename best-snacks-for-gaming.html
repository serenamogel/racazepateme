class=has-medium-font-size>Okay gamers, put on your headsets and listen up, because we are about to dive into the 11 best snacks for gaming (besides Cheetos and chopsticks, of course‚Äîthat one is a given).</p><p>And when we say best snacks for gaming, we don‚Äôt mean ‚Äúbest snacks to eat while casually playing Mario Kart with friends on a Saturday evening,‚Äù we mean ‚Äúbest snacks for feverishly trying to improve your Valorant ranking at 3 a.m. on a Wednesday when you absolutely do have work at 8:30 that morning.‚Äù In other words, we chose snacks that will keep you fed, hydrated, and ready to game all through the night. These are the best snacks for gamers.</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Valley Sweet & Salty Nut Almond Granola Bars&nbsp;</a></strong><p>Oh, Nature Valley bars. Once known as the ‚Äúafter school but before soccer practice bars‚Äù or the ‚Äúwhoops totally forgot to eat breakfast bars,‚Äù they‚Äôre in a league all their own according to the Sporked team. One could even call it a League of Legends üëÄ What makes these some of the best snacks for gaming? Well first of all the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Myrick</a> stamp of approval. They called these bars ‚Äúthe best granola bars they‚Äôve ever had in their life.‚Äù Why? Because they are ‚Äúsweet and salty, while also packing a flavor punch of oat and almond.‚Äù Also, the almond butter coating on the bottom of the bars tastes more like frosting than it tastes like almond butter. Try these out for a clean snack that won‚Äôt get all up in your RGB keyboard.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best granola bars</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Snyder‚Äôs of Hanover Snaps</a></strong><p>Snyders of Hanover Snaps are, according to Sporked contributor Danny Palumbo (Pennsylvania native and therefore a pretzel expert), the best pretzels out there. If you are looking for a non-greasy option to avoid getting smudges all over your brand new controllers, then these pretzels are for you. Danny called them ‚Äúproperly salted, crunchy but not dry, and easy to eat.‚Äù What more could you ask for in a snack you are going to absentmindedly eat an entire bag of while focused on more important things, like infiltrating your opponent‚Äôs base while also not dying?</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best pretzels</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Welch‚Äôs Mixed Fruit Snacks</a></strong><p>But Jessica, what am I supposed to snack on that‚Äôs not messy and also not salty? Don‚Äôt you worry, Princess Peach, I‚Äôll save you! (Side note: You ever feel like that woman is super capable of saving herself and just enjoys watching Mario struggle through like 14 bajillion different worlds just to be reunited with her?) Of course, fruit snacks are among the best snacks for gaming, and Welch‚Äôs are the classic best of the best. As Jordan put it, ‚ÄúThey are the most classic, fruit snack-y tasting fruit snacks you can possibly imagine,‚Äù and they have the perfect mix of real fruit flavor and that artificial punch every fruit snack should possess.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best fruit snacks</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fast Fixin‚Äô Chicken Breast Nuggets</a></strong><p>These beautiful chicken nuggets have made it onto a few of our <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best-of lists</a>. Why? Because they‚Äôre so good‚Äîrich, juicy, chicken-y, and, as Jordan put it, ‚Äúshockingly flavorful.‚Äù So flavorful, in fact, that they may not even need sauce. But why eat chicken nuggets while gaming? Well, they are salty, savory, can be popped into your mouth in one bite so you don‚Äôt have to hold on to anything, and, importantly, have a significant amount of protein to keep you energized and your health meter at the maximum level for an entire night of button mashing.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Frozen Chicken Nuggets That Are as Good as Fast Food</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>JIF Creamy Peanut Butter</strong></a><p>There are few things that can bring a person back to life quite like a spoonful of peanut butter (figuratively speaking, of course). If it‚Äôs 2 a.m. and all you need to get you through the next round is a heaping tablespoon of creamy, dreamy JIF, then by golly eat the creamy dreamy JIF. It truly is the best peanut butter out there. According to S;orked managing editor <a href=#>Gwynedd Stuart</a>, it has ‚Äúplenty of nutty flavor upon first bite‚Äù but then it evolves as ‚Äúsweetness rears its head, along with just the right amount of saltiness.‚Äù Truly the platonic idea of PB‚Äîthe favorite of choosy moms and one of the best snacks for gaming.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best peanut butter</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Frosted S‚Äômores Pop-Tarts</a></strong><p>Here we are again, yet another best gaming snack contender that has made its way onto several of our best snacks lists. These S‚Äômores Pop Tarts give gamers all of the flavor, warmth, and gooey satisfaction of a real s‚Äômore, all packaged up in a self-contained pastry pocket ready for on-the-go s‚Äômoreification without s‚Äômorifying your laptop keyboard by accident. Camp out by your computer with one of these bad boys and make all those internet randos jealous.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best Pop-Tarts flavors</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>GoMacro Sunny Uplift (Cherries + Berries)</strong></a><p>Hey, guess what? Vegans can be gamers, too. In fact, a lot of the gamers I know are vegan. But just because they are vegan does not mean they can get through a whole night of gaming without a protein-packed snack. That‚Äôs where these come in. These bars from GoMacro are protein-packed, delicious, and most of all, vegan! Gwynedd said this one was the best vegan protein bar she‚Äôs tasted (and, believe me, she has tasted a lot). It‚Äôs ‚Äúbursting with berry flavor‚Äù and ‚Äúfull of chewy dried cherries that give it a nice tart flavor.‚Äù If you are a vegan gamer (or any gamer really) and that sounds good to you, go get these and add ‚Äòem to your stash of gaming snacks to have them at the ready.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the best <a href=#>vegan protein bars</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fairlife Core Power Vanilla&nbsp;</a></strong><p>Yes, this is a milk product and not a Denver-based yoga gym. Brought to us by Fairlife, the ultra-filtered milk company, this vanilla protein shake apparently tastes like melted vanilla ice cream in a bottle according to Danny. It‚Äôs also low in sugar and has a whopping 26 grams of protein per bottle, so if you‚Äôre looking to drink your gamer fuel, and you‚Äôre not an energy drink person, this seems like the thick, creamy, drinkable protein for you.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bulk Up with the 5 Best Tasting Protein Shakes</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>PATH Still Water</strong></a><p>I know, I know. Why is there water on the snack list? Many reasons, so hear me out. For starters, this isn‚Äôt just any water, this is Sporked‚Äôs favorite canned water (yes, there is a difference between canned water options, and, yes, this was better than Liquid Death). Secondly, this stuff has electrolytes added to it (yay health, replenish those bad bois), which also make it taste like water with the ‚Äúslightest tinge of rain,‚Äù according to editor-in-chief <a href=#>Justine Sterling</a>. And thems is some poetic words about water. I‚Äôm not even sure I know what a tinge of rain tastes like but now I absolutely have to try it. And, lastly, People won‚Äôt know what you are drinking and will think you are super bougie, probably. I mean <a href=# rel=noopener>look at this sleek packaging</a>. It looks like it costs Voss money. You can intimidate your online opponents with this mystery drink that is really just sort of snazzy water.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best canned water</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Juice Monster Pipeline Punch</a></strong><p>It wouldn‚Äôt be a list of the best snacks for gaming without at least one energy drink. If you are going to be up all night virtually thirsty for the virtual blood of your virtual enemies (no real-life bloodlust allowed in this household), then you need a boost of energy, and what better way to get that boost than to chug (or daintily sip) 160 milligrams of caffeine that taste like POG and tropical fruits, in general. Juice Monster Pipeline Punch was so good that it had Link saying ‚Äúdang, dang, dang!‚Äù when he tried it on <a href=# rel=noopener>Good Mythical Morning</a>.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=#>best Monster energy drink flavors</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chomps Original Beef Stick</a></strong><p>Lastly but not leastly, every gamer snack arsenal needs a meat stick, and Chomps is the beefiest of the beef. That is to say, with their 100% grass-fed and grass-finished beef, this meat stick reminded Danny of ribeye steak and other literal cuts of beef while he was eating it. It tastes that truly beefy. So next time you need a mess-free meat stick to go with an intense night of Smash Bros, Chomps has got you covered while you simultaneously chomp your virtual enemies (or anyone else you have virtual beef with).</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Beef Sticks You Can Buy</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuv82amqSrXZu8s3nGmqSippdk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./donta-hightower-net-worth-2024.html>&#171;&nbsp;DontA Hightower Net Worth 2024</a>
