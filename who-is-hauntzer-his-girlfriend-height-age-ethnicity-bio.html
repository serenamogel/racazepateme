clubs, as the case may be, buy players or loan them out for a given period.&nbsp;Gradually, eSports has not only become mainstream, but teams are also following the same model with its players.&nbsp;Hauntzer is a player who has played for many teams and who has come to establish himself.</span></p><p><span>He is a professional&nbsp;</span><span>League of Legends</span><span>&nbsp;player who plays high laner in the League of Legends Championship Series North America, for the Golden Guardians.&nbsp;A very big name in League of Legends, he has already played for other teams, notably The Gentlemen’s Guild with which he started professionally and Team SoloMid.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Bio (Age and Ethnicity) – Who is Hauntzer?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Even though in the gaming world the player is popular as Hauntzer, his real name is Kevin Yarnell.&nbsp;A professional League of Legends actor, he was born on May 20, 1995 in the United States.&nbsp;Hauntzer is an American of Chinese/American ethnicity.</span></p><p><span>That said, he has managed to keep everything about his parents and siblings, if he has any, away from the media.&nbsp;More so, its educational status is not known as information about it is also kept away from the public domain by the first tape.</span></p><p><span>He was raised in Seattle, Washington, where he started playing video games at an early age.&nbsp;For League of Legends, which would later make him famous, he started his career while still in high school.</span></p><p><span>Professionally, Hauntzer started his career with The Gentlemen’s Guild in 2013, but after just two months, he joined the LoLPro team where he spent less than a year.&nbsp;His next team was Curse Academy, where he stayed for a few months, then he signed for Gravity Gaming from January to November 2015. It was from there that he moved on to Team SoloMid.</span></p><p><span>In 2018, Hauntzer made a rather shocking move from TSM to the team he now plays for, Golden Guardians.&nbsp;The transfer didn’t just shock fans and followers of the sport;&nbsp;it was also up to Kevin who revealed that he had not been given notice of the transfer in progress or a provision allowing him to share the starting points he had lost.</span></p><p><span>During his three years with the organization, he proved to be even better than the good player everyone expected him to be.&nbsp;Even when the team had a very difficult season in 2018, he was still in sight.&nbsp;Nonetheless, he was later dropped from the starting lineup for Sergen “Broken Blade” Çelik.&nbsp;With the team, he won three NA LCS playoff titles.</span></p><p><span>With GGS, he again secured the top spot among top laners, alongside big names such as Kim “Olleh” Joo-sung, Henrik “Froggen” Hansen, and Juan “Contractz” Garcia.</span></p><p><span>Talking about his move, the prolific top lanerEven though he didn’t think it was the wisest move from his former team, it was still a good opportunity for him as it allowed him to be in a better situation.</span></p><p><span>From 19 tournaments, Kevin who is as of 2019 ranked 733 in the world and 150 in the US has generated a total earning of over $135,000 over the 19 tournaments he has participated in.&nbsp;He’s recorded a lot in his career, winning the Riot NA LCS three times and placing second and third once.&nbsp;He also won the 2017 Rift Rivals.</span></p><h2><strong><span>His girlfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>When it comes to his relationship side of life, Hauntzer also tries to keep his balance just like he plays his games.&nbsp;For someone who has a girlfriend, one of the main issues he had with TSM was that he was always too busy to even call his girlfriend and do other little things.</span></p><p><span>He had a relationship with a woman identified as Hana.&nbsp;The two have been a topic of discussion on social media for the past few years.&nbsp;In 2018, he shared a photo of it on his Instagram account.&nbsp;they were having a good time skating.&nbsp;Hana also shares her photo with Kevin on her social media pages.&nbsp;Although little is known about Hana, it is known that she has a Twitch account that has over 4,000 followers.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Hauntzer’s&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>height</span></strong></h2><p><span>Kevin Yarnell is a very tall man who is 5 feet 10 inches tall.&nbsp;This is complemented by his body and athleticism.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMoZiupqSvsrN5x6KqZp%2BZp7mnvsiepZ1lmJq2qLTTZpignV2awam6yJygrbFdl7awew%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./alex-zedra-height-age-boyfriend-biography-wiki-net-worth-8562-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Alex Zedra Height, Age, Boyfriend, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth</a>
