She has appeared in several movies and TV series including Buffy the Vampire Slayer, What Lies Beneath and Evolution. Towne was once married to English actor – Sons of Anarchy star, Charlie Hunnam. Their union lasted for three years which Hunnam has since described as ‘terrible’, ‘painful’ and ‘expensive’. So, what led their fairytale union to such a state? All these and much more will be disclosed below.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bio-age></span><strong>Bio (Age)</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Katharine Payne Towne was born on the 17th of July 1978 in Hollywood Los Angeles, California. She spent her formative years in tinsel town and completed her education there. Towne’s parents were both involved in the movie industry and she naturally followed their footsteps into Hollywood. At first, she initially aspired to be a screenwriter and focused on that direction. She, however, realized early that her passion lay in acting and switched directions. Katharine Towne honed her skills in acting classes and soon landed a minor part in the 1998 movie, Without Limits. This marked her official Hollywood debut. Since then, she has featured in several movies and TV series.</p><p>On the big screen, Towne has appeared in movies such as Cool Girl (1998), She’s All That (1999), Go (1999), But I’m a Cheerleader (1999), The Bachelor (1999), Mulholland Drive (2000), The In Crowd (2000), What Lies Beneath (2000), Town & Country (2000), Sol Goode (2001), Evolution (2001), The Anarchist Cookbook (2002), LD 50 Lethal Dose (2003), Easy Six (2003), Easy Sex (2005), Dingle, Barry (2005), Something New (2006), Blades of Glory (2007), Amar (2009), and Ben Banks (2012).&nbsp; On the small screen, Katharine Towne has appeared in TV series such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1999), Tell Me You Love Me (2007) and CSI: NY (2011).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=family-life></span><strong>Family Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Katharine Towne hails from a family that can rightly be described as Hollywood royalty. Her father, Robert Towne is an accomplished Hollywood screenwriter as well as a filmmaker. He wrote the scripts for movies such as Mission Impossible as well as the 1974 film, Chinatown. Chinatown is regarded as one of the greatest films of all times and fetched him an Oscar for best original screenplay. Towne’s mom is named Julie Payne. She is an actress and appeared in several movies and TV shows between 1959 and 1967. Katharine Towne also boasts of some accomplished grandparents. Her maternal grandfather, John Payne and her maternal grandmother, Shirley Anne, were both accomplished actors. Shirley even received an Oscar nomination for best-supporting actress for her role in the 1937 movie, Stella Dallas.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=relationship-with-charlie-hunnam></span><strong>Relationship With Charlie Hunnam</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Katharine Towne was previously married to Charlie Hunnam – an English actor as well as a model. He has appeared in movies such as Green Street, The Ledge, Deadfall, The Lost City of Z, and King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. He has also appeared in TV series such as Queer as Folk, Young Americans, Undeclared and Sons of Anarchy, where he plays the role of the main protagonist, Jax Teller. Towne first met her ex-husband in 1999 at an audition for Dawson’s Creek. She was 20 at the time while he was 18 years of age. They quickly fell in love with each and spent the next three weeks in a whirlwind romance. Their love was so strong and intoxicating that they decided to get married after just three weeks together.</p><p>The duo promptly headed to Las Vegas and got married at the Silver Bell Wedding Chapel. Given their story, one would have thought that their love would endure forever but that was not the case. The couple were married for just three years and divorced in 2002. Hunnam later described their three-year union as ‘terrible’, ‘painful’ and ‘expensive’. In fact, the actor had nothing positive to say about the union. Since the divorce, both parties have moved on with their individual lives. Hunnam is now in a long-term relationship with jewellery designer, Morgana McNelis, and they have been together since 2005. Towne, on the other hand, has been involved in some relationships as well. She once dated actor, Ethan Embry. They were even engaged to be married but called off their engagement in 2014.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=height></span><strong>Height</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Katharine Towne boasts of quintessential golden looks as well as a stunning figure. She is 5 feet 7 inches (1.7m) tall and weighs 57kg. Her hair colour is blonde while her eye colour is green. Other additional measurements are bust size – 36 inches, waist size – 24 inches and hips – 34 inches. Even though the actress has not disclosed her fitness plan, there is no doubt that her figure is down to a healthy lifestyle and diet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKORqbWivsinnGasn6y7pnnBoqZmmZeaeqmxyKCfrWWimrmiwMiopaygmaV6uLXToWScoJGnuaqxjKGsp6aRonw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./nazanin-kavari-net-worth-172903.html>&#171;&nbsp;Nazanin Kavari Net Worth</a>
