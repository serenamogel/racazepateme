It was formerly known as <b>color</b> (Japanese: <b>色(いろ)</b> <i>color</i>) in <a href=# title="Wizards of the Coast">Wizards of the Coast</a> published expansions. On Pokémon, it is sometimes referred to as a <b>Pokémon type</b>.<a href=#>[1]</a><a href=#>[2]</a><a href=#>[3]</a> It is based on the <a href=# title=Type>type</a> mechanic from the <a href=# title="Pokémon games">Pokémon games</a>. There are eleven types currently in the game.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Available_types>Available types</span></h2><p>The Pokémon TCG has eleven Energy types. These are <a href=# title="Colorless (TCG)">Colorless</a>, <a href=# title="Grass (TCG)">Grass</a>, <a href=# title="Fire (TCG)">Fire</a> , <a href=# title="Water (TCG)">Water</a>, <a href=# title="Lightning (TCG)">Lightning</a>, <a href=# title="Fighting (TCG)">Fighting</a>, <a href=# title="Psychic (TCG)">Psychic</a>, <a href=# title="Darkness (TCG)">Darkness</a>, <a href=# title="Metal (TCG)">Metal</a>, <a href=# title="Dragon (TCG)">Dragon</a> and <a href=# title="Fairy (TCG)">Fairy</a>. Despite the name of "Colorless", it is still an Energy type. Only some older cards like <a href=# title="Venomoth (Jungle 13)">Venomoth</a> from <a href=# title="Jungle (TCG)">Jungle</a> act like Colorless is not a Energy type, or color as it was sometimes referred to back them, by allowing the player to choose any type except for Colorless.</p><p>Four types of the aforementioned types were added in later expansions. Darkness and Metal were first introduced in <a href=# title="Neo Genesis (TCG)">Neo Genesis</a>, Dragon in <a href=# title="Dragons Exalted (TCG)">Dragons Exalted</a>, and Fairy in <a href=# title="Kalos Starter Set (TCG)">Kalos Starter Set</a>. Of these, the Fairy type was retired in February 2020 with the release of the <a href=# title="Sword & Shield (TCG)">Sword & Shield</a> expansion.<a href=#>[4]</a> As such, no cards that have Fairy as an Energy type have been printed since that expansion.</p><p>As an adaption of the Pokémon video games, some complexities occur regarding typing. The games have nineteen types, compared to the TCG's eleven. This means some compression occurs between mediums so that every <a href=# title="Pokémon (species)">Pokémon</a> can be represented on a card with an Energy type. For example, <a href=# title="Fighting (type)">Fighting</a>-, <a href=# title="Rock (type)">Rock</a>- and <a href=# title="Ground (type)">Ground-type</a> Pokémon from the games are all featured as <a href=# title="Fighting (TCG)">Fighting-type</a> cards. The table to the right demonstrates a number of these simplifications. Note that the video game typing assigned to each particular Energy type has changed depending on different series. This has been indicated via hover text in the table, and on the articles for the respective Energy types.</p><p>For the most part, the names of a type from the games compared to an Energy type is a direct match. However, the <a href=# title="Electric (type)">Electric-type</a> is represented by the <a href=# title="Lightning (TCG)">Lightning</a> Energy type, <a href=# title="Dark (type)">Dark-type</a> is represented by the <a href=# title="Darkness (TCG)">Darkness</a> Energy type, and <a href=# title="Steel (type)">Steel-type</a> is represented by the <a href=# title="Metal (TCG)">Metal</a> Energy type,</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Properties>Properties</span></h2><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/6/63/ClawitzerFusionStrike75.jpg/300px-ClawitzerFusionStrike75.jpg decoding=async width=200 height=279 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=# title="Clawitzer (Fusion Strike 75)">Clawitzer</a> is a <a href=# title="Water (TCG)">Water-type</a> Pokemon.

For example, the <i>Ice Shard</i> <a href=# title="Attack (TCG)">attack</a> on <a href=# title="Snover (Ultra Prism 37)">Snover</a> and <a href=# title="Snover (Forbidden Light 3)">Snover</a> deals more damage to Pokémon that are <a href=# title="Fighting (TCG)">Fighting-type</a>, and the <i>Hydro Pump</i> attack on <a href=# title="Keldeo (Boundaries Crossed 47)">Keldeo</a> deals 10 more damage for every <a href=# title=Water><img alt=Water src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/1/11/Water-attack.png/30px-Water-attack.png decoding=async width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Energy attached to Keldeo.</p><p>Every Energy type has a symbol to represent it, which is printed prominently on cards of that Energy type. For example, the <a href=# title="Grass (TCG)">Grass-type</a> is represented by a stylized leaf on a green background, and the <a href=# title="Psychic (TCG)">Psychic-type</a> is represented by a stylized eye on a purple background.</p><p>The <a href=# title="Colorless (TCG)">Colorless-type</a> has the peculiar property of being something of a "neutral" type, due to Colorless costs in attacks being a wildcard symbol that can be met using Energy of any type.</p><h2><span id=Types_of_Pok.C3.A9mon></span><span class=mw-headline id=Types_of_Pokémon>Types of Pokémon</span></h2><p>Most Pokémon have a single type. For example, the <a href=# title="Steenee (Chilling Reign 14)">Steenee</a> from <a href=# title="Chilling Reign (TCG)">Chilling Reign</a> is <a href=# title="Grass (TCG)">Grass-type</a>. The type of a Pokémon card is displayed as a symbol in the upper right corner of the card. Some Pokémon are <a href=# class=new title="Dual-type Pokémon (TCG) (page does not exist)">Dual-type Pokémon</a>, and they have two types. Dual-type Pokémon were first introduced in the <a href=# title="EX Team Magma vs Team Aqua (TCG)">EX Team Magma vs Team Aqua</a> expansion. This property is displayed slightly differently depending on the set, with the more recent ones from <a href=# title="Steam Siege (TCG)">Steam Siege</a> and the <a href=# class=new title="HeartGold & SoulSilver Series (TCG) (page does not exist)">HeartGold & SoulSilver Series</a> displaying both symbols. Older cards from the <a href=# class=new title="EX Series (TCG) (page does not exist)">EX Series</a> are always either part <a href=# title="Darkness (TCG)">Darkness-type</a> or <a href=# title="Metal (TCG)">Metal-type</a>, and a variation of the symbol of their non-Darkness or Metal type but with a background based on the Darkness or Metal type. (Those cards have an extra text box explaining their Energy types with both symbols.)</p><p>The type of a Pokémon has little inherent rules meaning. It is a property that other cards refer to, rather than something that affects how a Pokémon behaves. However, the Energy type of a card often has correlations with the text of the rest of the card.</p><ul><li>The costs of the <a href=# title="Attack (TCG)">attacks</a> that a Pokémon has usually have the same type as the Pokémon or include <a href=# title=Colorless><img alt=Colorless src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/1/1d/Colorless-attack.png/30px-Colorless-attack.png decoding=async width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Energy. Some attacks have costs that are a mix of both.<ul><li><a href=# title="Dragon (TCG)">Dragon-type</a> Pokémon are exceptions, as Energy cannot be Dragon-typed. Instead, Dragon-type Pokémon have attacks with costs containing other Energy types.</li></ul></li><li>If a Pokémon has effects that reference Pokémon and Energy of a specific Energy type in a positive manner, that type will usually be the type of the Pokémon.</li></ul><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/3/39/ScovillainObsidianFlames25.jpg/300px-ScovillainObsidianFlames25.jpg decoding=async width=200 height=279 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=# title="Scovillain (Obsidian Flames 25)">Scovillain</a> is a <a href=# title="Grass (TCG)">Grass-type</a> Pokemon, even though the <a href=# title="Scovillain (Pokémon)">species</a> in the video games is quite prominently a dual <a href=# title="Grass (type)">Grass</a>/<a href=# title="Fire (type)">Fire</a> type. Sometimes, the TCG represents this concept by using an Ability that allows the card to have both typings.<p>Even with this in mind, there are many cards which do not follow this these conventions. Some cards will have one Energy type, but have attacks with costs that include other Energy types. For instance, one <a href=# title="Quagsire (Ancient Origins 39)">Quagsire</a> card from <a href=# title="Ancient Origins (TCG)">Ancient Origins</a> is <a href=# title="Fighting (TCG)">Fighting-type</a>, but both of its attacks have costs including <a href=# title=Water><img alt=Water src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/1/11/Water-attack.png/30px-Water-attack.png decoding=async width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Energy. This often correlates to a typing the species has in the video games that is not the typing of the specific card. However, there are a number of cases where cards have Energy types in their attack costs that do not have a basis in the video games. Many of these cases are part of specific groups of Pokémon, such as <a href=# title="Amazing Pokémon (TCG)">Amazing Pokémon</a> or <a href=# title="Crystal Pokémon (TCG)">Crystal Pokémon</a>.</p><p>A card's typing affects the rest of the card's aesthetic, as the frame of a Pokémon card is the same color as the type. For <a href=# title="Darkness (TCG)">Darkness-type</a> Pokémon, this causes text on the card to be printed in white instead of black. This does not always apply to Dual-type Pokémon that are Darkness-type.: In Steam Siege only the portions of the card printed on a black background used white text, while in EX Team Magma vs Team Aqua the cards just used regular black text. <a href=# class=new title="Reverse Holofoil (TCG) (page does not exist)">Reverse Holofoil</a> Pokémon cards starting from <a href=# title="Emerging Powers (TCG)">Emerging Powers</a>, with some exceptions for specific groups of Pokémon cards, have <a href=# title=Holofoil>holofoil</a> patterns that incorporate the symbol of the Energy type of the Pokémon.</p><p>A Pokémon can change its type through certain effects, overwriting the original typing of the card. For instance, <a href=# title="Wash Rotom (Rising Rivals RT5)">Wash Rotom</a> has an <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Poké-Power (TCG)">Poké-Power</a> which swaps its Energy type from <a href=# title="Lightning (TCG)">Lightning-type</a> to <a href=# title="Water (TCG)">Water-type</a>. Meanwhile, older card <a href=# title="Smeargle (Wizards Promo 32)">Smeargle</a> has an attack that places Coloring <a href=# class=new title="Counter (TCG) (page does not exist)">counters</a> that change the opponent's Energy type to a chosen non-Colorless type. Some of these effects can make a Pokémon have two types. For example, <a href=# title="Hoopa V (SWSH Promo 176)">Hoopa</a><a href=# title=V><img alt=V src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/8/8e/Pok%C3%A9mon_V.png/45px-Pok%C3%A9mon_V.png decoding=async width=30 height=22 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> is <a href=# title="Psychic (TCG)">Psychic-type</a>, but its <i>Two-Faced</i> <a href=# title="Ability (TCG)">Ability</a> makes it a a Psychic-type and <a href=# title="Darkness (TCG)">Darkness-type</a> card once it is in play. Some of these effects are active as soon as the Pokémon enters play, but others like <i>Dual Armor</i> on <a href=# title="Lucario (Plasma Storm 78)">Lucario</a> with collector number 78 from <a href=# title="Plasma Storm (TCG)">Plasma Storm</a> have to be activated through specific game actions. Technically, through such effects, a Pokémon can have any number of types. The <a href=# title="Kecleon (Rising Rivals 67)">Kecleon</a> from <a href=# title="Rising Rivals (TCG)">Rising Rivals</a> has a <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Poké-Body (TCG)">Poké-Body</a> that just makes it every extant type at time of printing, all at once. However, effects that change the type of a Pokémon other than the one the effect is printed on are rare.</p><p>There are also effects that can add types to Pokémon without replacing types, which are also rare. Three such examples are the <a href=# title="Flareon (Ancient Origins 13)">Flareon</a>, <a href=# title="Vaporeon (Ancient Origins 22)">Vaporeon</a>, and <a href=# title="Jolteon (Ancient Origins 26)">Jolteon</a> cards from <a href=# title="Ancient Origins (TCG)">Ancient Origins</a>, which have Abilities that add the Pokémon's respective Energy type to all of their owner's <a href=# title="Stage 1 Pokémon (TCG)">Stage 1 Pokémon</a> without replacing their original types. This combines with the prior overwriting effects in the most optimal manner, resulting in a Pokémon that has every Energy type an effect says that it has along with all of the Energy types being added to. If <a href=# title="Scovillain (Obsidian Flames 25)">Scovillain</a> is being affected by these Vaporeon and Jolteon, then Scovillian would be a Grass/Fire/Water/Lightning Pokémon. <a href=#>[5]</a></p><h3><span id=Weakness_.26_Resistance></span><span class=mw-headline id=Weakness_&_Resistance>Weakness & Resistance</span></h3><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/1/1e/CorvisquirePaldeaEvolved165.jpg/300px-CorvisquirePaldeaEvolved165.jpg decoding=async width=200 height=279 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=# title="Corvisquire (Paldea Evolved 165)">Corvisquire</a> is a <a href=# title="Colorless (TCG)">Colorless-type</a> Pokemon, and the species is a <a href=# title="Flying (type)">Flying</a> type in the video games. This correlates with the Weakness and Resistance seen on the card. As per the bottom of the card, this card's <a href=# title="Lightning (TCG)">Lightning-type</a> Weakness means it takes double the damage from an attack used by a Lightning-type Pokémon, and it has a <a href=# title="Fighting (TCG)">Fighting-type</a> Resistance, so it takes 30 less damage from any attacks from a Fighting-type Pokémon<p>One of the key ways a Pokémon type matters is through Weakness and Resistance. Weakness and Resistance are game mechanics that can change how much damage a Pokémon takes from an attack.<a href=#>[6]</a></p><p>Pokémon cards usually have an Energy type as an Weakness. When a Pokémon is an Active Pokémon and it takes damage from the attack of a Pokémon that has the same type as that Weakness, the first Pokémon takes increased damage from that attack. The effect that the Weakness has on the damage of the attack is always printed next to the Energy type of that Weakness, called an "amount" Traditionally, this is "x2", with the "x" standing for multiplication, meaning the damage is doubled from the what it was before calculating Weakness. However, cards from the <a href=# title="Pokémon Trading Card Game">Diamond & Pearl Series</a> and the <a href=# title="Pokémon Trading Card Game">Platinum Series</a> vary from this standard. Many cards from those sets have weaknesses that call for adding damage instead of multiplying, such as a "+20" indicating that 20 damage is added to the attack's damage.</p><p>Some Pokémon cards have an Energy type as an Resistance. This works almost identically to Weakness, except that now the Pokémon takes less damage from the attack instead of more. The exact effect of Resistances have varied depending on the set, but the most traditional effect is "-30", reducing the damage that an attack deals by 30. From the <a href=# title="Pokémon Trading Card Game">Diamond & Pearl Series</a> to the <a href=# class=new title="Sword & Shield Series (TCG) (page does not exist)">Sword & Shield Series</a>, most Pokémon with a Resistance reduce the damage by 20 instead of 30.</p><p>If a Pokémon has both a Weakness and a Resistance to the Energy type of a Pokémon using an attack, then the damage is first modified by the Weakness, then the Resistance.</p><p>Only damage calculation regarding an Active Pokémon takes Weakness and Resistance into account. When <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Benched Pokémon">Benched Pokémon</a> take damage, these characteristics are ignored unless a card otherwise says to take them into account. One example is <a href=# title="Steam Siege (TCG)">Steam Siege</a>'s <a href=# title="Galvantula (Steam Siege 42)">Galvantula</a>, which as an attack that damages Benched Pokémon and applies Weakness and Resistance for that damage. <a href=# title="Wide Lens (Roaring Skies 95)">Wide Lens</a> is a <a href=# title="Pokémon Tool card (TCG)">Pokémon Tool card</a> that makes all attacks work in this manner, but the attack does have to damage a Benched Pokémon to begin with.</p><p>Certain attacks have effects that make them ignore Weakness and Resistance in damage calculation. Even if a Pokémon using one of these attacks has an Energy type matching that of a Defending Pokémon's Weakness or Resistance, the damage being dealt will not be changed by either characteristic. One such attack can be found on <a href=# title="Electrode (Fusion Strike 88)">Electrode</a>. This is traditionally written as a variation on, "This attack's damage isn't affected by Weakness or Resistance." It is also possible for attack to not be affected by Weakness, and for an attack to not be affected by Resistance, but not both of them at once. <a href=# title="Zapdos (Team Up 40)">Zapdos</a> has an attack that is an example of the former, <a href=# title="Rhyperior (Sword & Shield 99)">Rhyperior</a> has an attack that is an example of the latter. Ignoring Resistances is an upside, but ignoring Weakness is a downside.</p><p>These effects often comes bundled with an effect that ignores any other effect on the <a href=# title="Appendix:Glossary (TCG)">Defending Pokémon</a>, as seen on the card <a href=# title="Cornerstone Mask Ogerpon ex (Twilight Masquerade 112)">Cornerstone Mask Ogerpon ex</a>. Despite the usual wording of "isn't affected by Weakness or Resistance, or by any effects on your opponent's Active Pokémon," Weakness and Resistance are not effects. As stated before, they are game mechanics.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/6/66/PorygonBaseSet39.jpg/300px-PorygonBaseSet39.jpg decoding=async width=200 height=283 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=# title="Porygon (Base Set 39)">Porygon</a>, the only card with an attack that can modify the opponents Weakness and an attack that can modify the opponents Resistance. Notice that Colorless is not a valid choice for either. This is an older card, where this was the status quo for type selecting effects.<p>Pokémon usually have one Energy type as a Weakness. A rare few cards like the <a href=# title="Sableye (XY 68)">Sableye</a> in <a href=# title="XY (TCG)">XY</a> and the <a href=# title="Spiritomb (Unbroken Bonds 112)">Spiritomb</a> in <a href=# title="Unbroken Bonds (TCG)">Unbroken Bonds</a> have the special property of having no Weakness. So too do all <a href=# title="Dragon (TCG)">Dragon-type</a> Pokémon released from <a href=# title="Evolving Skies (TCG)">Evolving Skies</a> onward. Some cards have one Energy type as a Resistance, but most cards lack it. The vast majority of <a href=# title="Metal (TCG)">Metal-type</a> Pokémon have a Resistance, but the Energy type of that Resistance varies depending on the set.</p><p>Certain Pokémon can have two Energy types as Weaknesses and/or Resistances. In these cases, both if a Pokémon using an attack against them has the Energy types of both Weaknesses and/or both Resistances, then the damage of the attack is modified twice by the Weakness and/or Resistance amount.<a href=#>[7]</a> Some cards that are known to make use of this are <a href=# title="Pokémon-ex (TCG)">Pokémon-ex</a> and <a href=# title="Pokémon LEGEND (TCG)">Pokémon LEGEND</a>, but this is by no means exclusive to those cards. (Equally true is that Pokémon with more than one Weakness or Resistance have not been printed since <a href=# title="EX Power Keepers (TCG)">EX Power Keepers</a>, save for Pokémon LEGEND.)</p><p>Some effects can change the Weakness and Resistance of Pokémon in play. Most commonly, this is to remove the Weakness from a card, as seen on the very literally named <a href=# title="Weakness Guard (Aquapolis 141)">Weakness Guard</a> and <a href=# title="Weakness Guard Energy (Unified Minds 213)">Weakness Guard Energy</a>, or as an effect on one of <a href=# title="Gardevoir-EX (Primal Clash 105)">Gardevoir-EX</a>'s attacks. Resistance can also be removed in this way, like on <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Magnetic Storm (Flashfire 91)">Magnetic Storm</a>. Other effects can overwrite the Energy type of the Weakness of a card, such as the attack on <a href=# title="Porygon (151 137)">Porygon</a> from <a href=# title="151 (TCG)">151</a> or one attack on <a href=# title="Meowstic (Unbroken Bonds 80)">Meowstic</a> from Unbroken Bonds. These effects do not change the amount of Weakness, only the Energy type of that Weakness. If there was no Weakness before, these effects will set the amount to "x2". Other effects can indeed change an amount of Weakness, usually setting it to "x4" and really boosting the damage. Examples of that include the Abilities on <a href=# title="Vileplume (Boundaries Crossed 3)">Vileplume</a> from <a href=# title="Boundaries Crossed (TCG)">Boundaries Crossed</a> and <a href=# title="Kabutops (151 141)">Kabutops</a> from 151. These effects will not do anything to a card that has no Energy type as a Weakness. Uniquely, the card <a href=# title="Supereffective Glasses (Astral Radiance 152)">Supereffective Glasses</a> changes the amount of Weakness applied during damage calculation, if it is being applied, to "x3". This means the characteristic of the Defending Pokémon does not change despite the damage from the attack. being increased more than normal.</p><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Metagame>Metagame</span></h4><table align=center><tbody readability=2.5><tr readability=5><td width=50px align=center><a href=# class=image><img alt=050Diglett.png src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/a/a6/0050Diglett.png/75px-0050Diglett.png decoding=async width=50 height=50 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td><td><b>This section is incomplete.</b><br>Please feel free to edit this section to add missing information and complete it.<br>Reason: now that this article is at normal length, a competitive player has to weigh in here to balance things out.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>According to the game's director, <a href=# title="Atsushi Nagashima">Atsushi Nagashima</a>, the metagame of the TCG has traditionally focused on "a rock-paper-scissors relationship" between <a href=# title="Grass (TCG)">Grass</a>, <a href=# title="Fire (TCG)">Fire</a>, and <a href=# title="Water (TCG)">Water</a> Pokémon. However, it was believed that the metagame had been shifting too rapidly, and as such, the <a href=# title="List of Pokémon Trading Card Game expansions">Sword & Shield Series</a> would expand the focus to further incorporate <a href=# title="Lightning (TCG)">Lightning</a> and <a href=# title="Fighting (TCG)">Fighting</a> Pokémon.<a href=#>[8]</a><a href=#>[9]</a></p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Gym_Leader_Challenge>Gym Leader Challenge</span></h3><p>The <a href=# title="Gym Leader Challenge format (TCG)">Gym Leader Challenge format</a> uses Pokémon type as part of its ruleset. A legal <a href=# title=Deck>deck</a> in Gym Leader Challenge can only contain Pokémon that share a single type. Those Pokémon can have types in addition to this shared type. This restriction only checks Pokémon as they exist outside of play, fully ignoring effects printed on cards that change their own type.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Relationship_to_Video_Games>Relationship to Video Games</span></h3><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/d/d5/CoalossalRebelClash107.jpg/300px-CoalossalRebelClash107.jpg decoding=async width=200 height=279 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=# title="Coalossal (Rebel Clash 107)">Coalossal</a> is a card for a <a href=# title="Coalossal (Pokémon)">species</a> that is <a href=# title="Rock (type)">Rock</a>/<a href=# title="Fire (type)">Fire</a>. This card takes after the Rock typing, but Rock is not an Energy type. Pokemon that are Rock-type are printed as cards of the Fighting Energy type, and this card follows suit by having that Energy type. However, the Ability Tar Generator nods back at the Rock/Fire typing by affecting both Fighting and Fire Energy in a positive manner. Note that the card has a Weakness of Grass, matching a weakness of the Rock type from the game.<p>As an adaption of the Pokémon video games, many details of Pokémon cards regarding Energy types call back to elements seen in the games. The Energy type that a Pokémon card has usually matches one of the types the species has in the video games. For example, <a href=# title="Infernape (Pokémon)">Infernape</a> is a <a href=# title="Fire (type)">Fire</a>/<a href=# title="Fighting (type)">Fighting</a>-type Pokémon in the games, so <a href=# title="Infernape (TCG)">Infernape</a> cards tend to be either <a href=# title="Fire (TCG)">Fire-type</a> or <a href=# title="Fighting (TCG)">Fighting-type</a>. For the Pokémon in the games that have types do not have a corresponding Energy type, they get cards that have Energy types that their typing has been grouped into, as per the table at the start of the article. One example of this is that <a href=# title="Rock (type)">Rock</a>- and <a href=# title="Ground (type)">Ground-type</a> Pokémon from the games get cards in the TCG that have the <a href=# title="Fighting (TCG)">Fighting</a> Energy type.</p><p>As stated before, if a Pokémon card has attacks that have costs which include Energy types that are not Colorless or the same Energy type of the card, the Energy types of that cost are likely to be Energy types based on the typing of the species in the video game that is not the card's Energy type.</p><p>Generally speaking, if a Pokémon card has effects that reference an Energy type in a positive manner and that type is not of the Energy type of the card, those effects will benefit the typing based on the typing of the species in the video game that is not the card's Energy type.</p><p>The Weakness and Resistance of Pokémon cards usually are based on their weaknesses in the games; for example, <a href=# title="Ice (type)">Ice</a> is folded into <a href=# title="Water (TCG)">Water-type</a> in the TCG, but Pokémon cards with the Water Energy type representing Ice-type Pokémon in the video games have a Weakness of <a href=# title="Metal (TCG)">Metal</a>, much like how in the <a href=# title="Core series">core series</a> <a href=# title="Ice (type)">Ice-type</a> is weak to <a href=# title="Steel (type)">Steel</a>.</p><p>As is always true of trading card games, these patterns do not hold in every circumstance. Sometimes, a Pokémon card has an Energy type that does not correspond with the types the species has in the video games. Other times, their Weakness and Resistance actively contradict the video games by holding true to the TCG pattern, or they are just Energy types that do not match the species's weaknesses and resistances in the video game. Sometimes, this has to do with certain groups of cards that have mechanical implications, such as <a href=# title="Dark Pokémon (TCG)">Dark Pokémon</a>, <a href=# class=new title="Rocket's Pokémon (TCG) (page does not exist)">Rocket's Pokémon</a>, <a href=# title="Δ Delta Species (TCG)">δ Delta Species</a> and <a href=# title="Crystal Pokémon (TCG)">Crystal Pokémon</a>.</p><p>The pages for each Energy type make note of these correlations between video game and trading card game.</p><h4><span id=.22Attacks_and_types.22></span><span class=mw-headline id='"Attacks_and_types"'>"Attacks and types"</span></h4><p>One misconception of the TCG is that each attack has a type, and this type is what is used to determine if a Pokémon takes increased or decreased damage due to Weakness and Resistance. This line of thought further notes that the Energy types in the cost of an attack do not affect this "typing". This interpretation likely draws from the video games, where every <a href=# title=Move>move</a> has a type. This is false; even a rulebook for <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Base Set 2">Base Set 2</a>, the fourth expansion of the game, states that Weakness and Resistance are applied when the Energy type of the Pokémon using the attack matches.<a href=#>[10]</a>. However, this interpretation has been officially acknowledged in the past, in a question to Wizards of the Coast.<a href=#>[11]</a> It has also been listed on this very page as a truth.</p><p>However, it is true that sometimes, the TCG uses non-standard attack costs to be thematic. For example, <a href=# title="Surfing Pikachu (Wizards Promo 28)">Surfing Pikachu</a> is a <a href=# title="Lightning (TCG)">Lightning-type</a> Pokémon, but its <i>Surf</i> attack has a cost of <a href=# title=Water><img alt=Water src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/1/11/Water-attack.png/30px-Water-attack.png decoding=async width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title=Water><img alt=Water src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/1/11/Water-attack.png/30px-Water-attack.png decoding=async width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a>.

This Energy is also displayed in the upper right corner of the card. (The same provisions for Energy from Base Set or based on the appearance of those cards still applies.) However, most Special Energy cards do not have a non-Colorless Energy type until they are in play, even if their illustration appears to show so.<a href=#>[13]</a>. This means that effects that look for Energy of specific Energy types in zones that are not the in-play zone are unable to interact with Special Energy. (The primary exceptions to this are the Special Energy versions of Metal Energy and <a href=# title="Darkness Energy (Neo Genesis 104)">Darkness Energy</a>, which do have the Metal and Darkness Energy types while not in play.)</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/a/ac/BurningEnergyBREAKthrough151.jpg/300px-BurningEnergyBREAKthrough151.jpg decoding=async width=200 height=277 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=# title="Burning Energy (BREAKthrough 151)">Burning Energy</a> is a Special Energy card.

The Energy in the artwork is what is seen in the icons in the upper right corner, even if it does not exactly match an Energy type. For example, <a href=# title="Splash Energy (BREAKpoint 113)">Splash Energy</a> depicts a darkened version of Water Energy, which is exactly what the icon shows. Cards that provide more than one unit of Energy, such as <a href=# title="R Energy (EX Team Rocket Returns 95)">R Energy</a> and <a href=# title="Triple Acceleration Energy (Unbroken Bonds 190)">Triple Acceleration Energy</a>, have an icon in the upper right for every unit of Energy.</p><p>Also note that while <a href=# title="Dragon (TCG)">Dragon-type</a> Pokémon exist, Dragon Energy does not exist within the rules.

The Energy types of that Energy, and therefore the types of the Energy they are providing, have to match the Energy types contained within the cost. For instance, the <a href=# title="Garchomp (Dragons Exalted 90)">Garchomp</a> in <a href=# title="Legendary Treasures (TCG)">Legendary Treasures</a> has the attack <i>Dragonblade</i>, which has a cost of <a href=# title=Water><img alt=Water src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/1/11/Water-attack.png/30px-Water-attack.png decoding=async width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# title=Fighting><img alt=Fighting src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/4/48/Fighting-attack.png/30px-Fighting-attack.png decoding=async width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a>. For Garchomp to be able to use the attack, it needs an Energy card attached to it that provides <a href=# title=Water><img alt=Water src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/1/11/Water-attack.png/30px-Water-attack.png decoding=async width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Energy and an Energy card attached to it that provides <a href=# title=Fighting><img alt=Fighting src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/4/48/Fighting-attack.png/30px-Fighting-attack.png decoding=async width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Energy. A combination of <a href=# title="Basic Water Energy (TCG)">Basic Water Energy</a> and <a href=# title="Basic Fighting Energy (TCG)">Basic Fighting Energy</a> is the simplest way to meet this cost, but there are multiple other ways to mix and match Energy cards that allow Garchomp to use <i>Dragonblade</i>.

The absolute most iconic example is the <a href=# title="Charizard (Base Set 4)">Charizard</a> in <a href=# title="Base Set (TCG)">Base Set</a>, whose <i>Energy Burn</i> <a href=# title="Pokémon Power (TCG)">Pokémon Power</a> changes the Energy type of all Energy attached to it to <a href=# title="Fire (TCG)">Fire-type</a>.

Changing the Energy type of an Energy card in this way does not change the name of the card.<a href=#>[12]</a> As such, a <a href=# title="Basic Grass Energy (TCG)">Basic Grass Energy</a> attached to the Charizard would have an Energy type of <a href=# title="Fire (TCG)">Fire</a>, and provide <a href=# title=Fire><img alt=Fire src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/a/ad/Fire-attack.png/30px-Fire-attack.png decoding=async width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a>, but still be called Basic Grass Energy. This kind of effect interacts less than gracefully with Energy cards that can provide multiple types of Energy like the aforementioned Rainbow Energy. When this kind of card has its Energy type changed, the effect that allows the card to provide multiple different types of Energy ends.<a href=#>[14]</a></p><p>The prior effects overwrite an Energy's Energy type, but it is possible for a card to add Energy types without replacing the orginal type. The only such example is <a href=# title="Holon Research Tower (EX Delta Species 94)">Holon Research Tower</a>, which can add the Metal Energy type to any Energy attached to a Delta Species Pokémon. This effect works similarly to cards like <a href=# title="Unit Energy FDY (Forbidden Light 118)">Unit Energy FDY</a> and <a href=# title="Blend Energy GRPD (Dragons Exalted 117)">Blend Energy GRPD</a>, making it so that the Energy card can provide either Energy of its original Energy type or Metal Energy, but only 1 unit of either.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=In_the_video_games>In the video games</span></h2><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Trading_Card_Game_series>Trading Card Game series</span></h3><p>In <a href=# title="Pokémon Trading Card Game (video game)">Pokémon Trading Card Game</a> and <a href=# title="Pokémon Trading Card Game 2: The Invasion of Team GR!">Pokémon Trading Card Game 2: The Invasion of Team GR!</a>, there are seven available Pokémon types: <a href=# title="Grass (TCG)">Grass</a>, <a href=# title="Fire (TCG)">Fire</a>, <a href=# title="Water (TCG)">Water</a>, <a href=# title="Lightning (TCG)">Lightning</a>, <a href=# title="Fighting (TCG)">Fighting</a>, <a href=# title="Psychic (TCG)">Psychic</a>, and <a href=# title="Colorless (TCG)">Colorless</a>.</p><h3><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_Trading_Card_Game_Online></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_Trading_Card_Game_Online>Pokémon Trading Card Game Online</span></h3><p>In <a href=# title="Pokémon Trading Card Game Online">Pokémon Trading Card Game Online</a>, cards still have Energy types.
