The football player briefly acknowledged his divorce before asking for solitude and understanding from his fans and the media. Some assumed that Meem’s adultery was the basis for their breakup, as media linked her to Golden Tate, one of Wilson’s NFL teammates, who then took to social media to put the rumors to rest, calling them ludicrous.</p><p>He also mentioned that his wife and Ashton are good friends, and he concluded with a tweet about how football players’ personal life is unimportant to their performances on the pitch.</p><h3><span id=Also_Read_A_Look_At_The_Success_And_Relationships_Of_Joan-_Baez>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>A Look At The Success And Relationships Of Joan- Baez</a></span></h3><h2><span id=Is_Meem_married_or_dating_someone_right_now>Is Meem married or dating someone right now?</span></h2><p>Wilson divorced Ashton and began dating R&B singer Ciara, with whom he has a daughter named Sienna Princess Wilson, while Meem chose to remain silent on her relationship status.

He grew up in Virginia with two siblings, Harrison IV, his brother, and Anna, his sister. During his childhood, he was said to have enjoyed playing football with his brother and father, which foreshadowed his future career. In sixth grade, he played with the Tuckahoe Tomahawks in his first organized game. Russell attended Collegiate School, and due to his great stats, he was selected as an all-state player, among other honors.</p><p>In his final year of high school, he had a standout season, throwing 3,287 yards and 40 touchdown passes.</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Wilson redshirted in 2007 and began his career with NC State in 2008, where he remained for the following two years. He played for the Wisconsin Badgers until 2011 when he was drafted in the National Football League (NFL) Draft by the Seattle Seahawks, with whom he would have significant success.</p><p>In September of that year, he made his regular-season debut with 18 completions on 34 attempts in a loss to the Arizona Cardinals, followed by a 14-12 victory against the Green Bay Packers. Wilson was named Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week for his efforts during the NFL’s 10th week. The Seahawks started the 2013 season with four victories before falling to the Indianapolis Colts in the fifth week. The squad then went on a seven-game winning streak, most notably defeating the Minnesota Vikings 41-20, with Russell posting a career-high passing rating of 151.4.</p><p>He had an outstanding effort in the 13th week, tossing three touchdown passes and earning NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. The club would go on to win the Super Bowl. Russell had a big year in 2014, guiding his team to an 80-yard touchdown drive against the Packers to win the NFC Championship, then going on to lose in the Super Bowl to the Patriots.</p><h2><span id=Injury_and_Post-Career>Injury and Post-Career</span></h2><p>Wilson damaged his ankle and knee in 2016, limiting his mobility.</p><p>Many fans and sports analysts expected him to take some time off due to his ailment; yet, he continued to play and started all of the games this season. In 2017, his club won nine games, and in 2018, he was elected captain for the second time, with the team making the playoffs once more.</p><p>Russell signed a $140 million contract extension with the Seahawks in mid-2019, making him the highest-paid athlete in the National Football League.
