Even along highly active fault lines, it could take 100,000 years or more for minable deposits to form. So <b>yes, gold deposits can replenish themselves</b>.</span></span><h2>Does gold regenerate in the Earth?</h2>Gold sank to the Earth's core during the planet's formation. It's only accessible today because of asteroid bombardment. Theoretically, it's possible to form gold by the nuclear processes of fusion, fission, and radioactive decay.<h2>How much gold does the Earth have left?</h2>According to the US Geological Survey, the underground gold reserves are currently estimated at about 50,000 tons. From this perspective, a total of around 190,000 tonnes of gold has been mined like mentioned before, although these numbers vary.<h2>Do we have enough gold on Earth?</h2>More than 99 percent of Earth's gold is missing—it all sank to the center of the planet billions of years ago. In fact, says geologist Bernard Wood of Macquarie University in Australia, there's enough gold in Earth's core to coat its surface in 1.5 feet of the stuff.<h2>How much unmined gold is left?</h2>How much mineable gold is left? The World Gold Council estimates that remaining reserves worldwide amount to just 30% of what's been mined already -- 54,000 metric tons of gold in sufficient concentrations, and buried at sufficiently accessible depths, to be mined at reasonable cost.<h2>Where does gold come from? - David Lunney</h2><p></p><h2>How much unmined gold is in the world?</h2>According to experts, our best estimate is that there are between 190,000 and 200,000 tons of gold above ground. About two-thirds of that gold has been mined since the 1950s, while the first third had been mined throughout the thousands of years of preceding history.<h2>Is gold still being formed?</h2>Although gold deposits continue to form in active volcanic areas, greenstone belts and their gold deposits no longer form on Earth today. Examples include parts of Canada, Zimbabwe and Australia. 7. Placer deposits form at Earth's surface when weathering action exposes gold from other, older lode deposits.<h2>What happens when gold runs out?</h2>As gold prices go up, it'd be reasonable to expect that more gold is going to be recycled than at current rates (presently about 30% of supply). Grandma's unfashionable old jewellery, even the 9-carat stuff, is going to be well and truly worth selling. And e- and industrial waste will become even more valuable.<h2>Is there gold on the moon?</h2>Digging a little deeper than the Moon's crust, scientists have discovered that the Moon does indeed have a number of precious metals such as gold and silver.<h2>Did gold come from space?</h2>Did you know that gold is extraterrestrial? Instead of arising from our planet's rocky crust, it was actually cooked up in space and is present on Earth because of cataclysmic stellar explosions called supernovae. CERN Scientist David Lunney outlines the incredible journey of gold from space to Earth.<h2>What kind of soil is gold found in?</h2>Soils Associated with Gold Deposits. By far, the best-known type of soil which may indicate the presence of gold is known as “black sand.” Black sands are certainly not proof of the existence of nearby gold, only that the soil has a lot of minerals and heavy metals, one of which is gold.<h2>Who owns the most gold privately?</h2>Indian households have the largest private gold holdings in the world, standing at an estimated 24,000 metric tons. That figure surpasses the combined official gold reserves of the United States, Germany, Italy, France, China and Russia. See which countries have the largest gold reserves!<h2>What planet has the most gold?</h2>Well, at current market prices, 16 Psyche contain enough gold and other precious metals to be worth roughly $700 quintillion, which is enough to give every single human being on this planet a private fortune of nearly a hundred billion bucks.<h2>Is there gold in the ocean?</h2>One study found there is only about one gram of gold for every 100 million metric tons of ocean water in the Atlantic and north Pacific. There is also (undissolved) gold in/on the seafloor. The ocean, however, is deep, meaning that gold deposits are a mile or two underwater.<h2>Does sun have gold?</h2>Careful analysis of the Sun's spectrum shows that about 6 ten-billionths (0.0000000006) of the mass of the Sun consists of atoms of gold. Doesn't sound like much does it? But, because the Sun is so huge, this is a lot of gold!<h2>Can all the gold in the world fit in a swimming pool?</h2>Each cubic meter of water is one metric ton. Gold is 19.3 times as dense as water. Therefore an Olympic swimming pool would contain 48,250 metric tons of gold. It follows that 3.42 Olympic-sized swimming pools could contain all the gold that's ever been mined.<h2>Do gold mines still exist?</h2>Only one Colorado mine continues to produce gold, the Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mine at Victor near Colorado Springs, an open-pit heap leach operation owned by Newmont Mining Corporation, which produced 360,000 troy ounces (11,000 kg) of gold in 2018.<h2>What is the largest nugget of gold ever found?</h2>Holtermann 'Nugget': 10,229oz. While the Welcome Stranger is the largest gold nugget ever discovered, the single biggest gold specimen ever found is the Holtermann. Dug up in October 1872 by German miner Bernhardt Holtermann at Hill End in New South Wales, it was crushed, and the gold extracted.<h2>Is Diamond rarer than gold?</h2>But, in its elemental form, gold is significantly rarer than diamonds, Faul told Live Science. After all, carbon is one of the most abundant elements on Earth — especially in comparison to heavier metals like gold — and diamond is simply composed of carbon under immense pressure.<h2>How did gold get on Earth?</h2>On Earth, gold finally reached us some 200 million years after the formation of the planet when meteorites packed with gold and other metals bombarded its surface. During the formation of Earth, molten iron sank to its centre to make the core.<h2>Why is gold so valuable to humans?</h2>Gold's value is ultimately a social construction: it is valuable because we all agree it has been and will be in the future. Still, gold's lustrous and metallic qualities, its relative scarcity, and the difficulty of extraction have only added to the perception of gold as a valuable commodity.<h2>Why is there so much gold in Alaska?</h2>Most gold mined in Alaska comes from the sands and gravels of streams and rivers. Sands and gravels that contain accumulations of gold or other minerals, such as platinum, diamond, ruby, and sapphire, are called placers.<h2>Where is gold most likely to be found?</h2>Gold is primarily found as the pure, native metal. Sylvanite and calaverite are gold-bearing minerals. Gold is usually found embedded in quartz veins, or placer stream gravel. It is mined in South Africa, the USA (Nevada, Alaska), Russia, Australia and Canada.<h2>Where did Egypt get its gold?</h2>The Nile River carries gold all throughout. Much of Ancient Egypt's gold was sourced from this massive river. The two significant sources of Egyptian gold was found in a place called Nubia toward the South and in the Eastern deserts. Much of this is now part of present-day Sudan.<h2>What planet rains diamonds?</h2>Deep within Neptune and Uranus, it rains diamonds—or so astronomers and physicists have suspected for nearly 40 years. The outer planets of our Solar System are hard to study, however. Only a single space mission, Voyager 2, has flown by to reveal some of their secrets, so diamond rain has remained only a hypothesis.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8OonKxlpJ2ybrHAq6uhZaKava2xzaKqoWWXpLml</p></div><div id=links><a href=./germen-o-germen-y-germenes-o-germenes-ejemplos-como-se-escribe.html>&#171;&nbsp;Germen o grmen y grmenes o germenes ejemplos cmo se escribe</a>
