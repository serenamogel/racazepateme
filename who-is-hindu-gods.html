These categorical practices are sometimes described as, respectively, Vaishnavism (Vishnu), Shaivism (Shiva), and Shaktism (Shakti being another term for the female creative energy).<h2>What are the 5 main Hindu gods?</h2>Within Hinduism there are five major sects or denominations, Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism, Ganapatism, and Saurism whose followers consider Vishnu, Shiva, Shakti or Devi, Ganesha, and Surya to be the supreme deity respectively. Smartism sect considers all the above five deities as equal.<h2>Who is the real God in India?</h2>Hindus following Advaita Vedanta consider Ātman within every living being to be the same as Vishnu or Shiva or Devi, or alternatively identical to the eternal metaphysical Absolute, called Brahman in Hinduism.<h2>Who is the biggest God in India?</h2>Krishna is the supreme God of Hinduism. Most Hindus worship one Supreme Being, though by different names. This is because the peoples of India with different languages and cultures have understood the one God in their own distinct way.<h2>The Most Important Hindu Gods: Shiva - Vishnu - Brahma - Hanuman - Ganesha - Vol 1- See U in History</h2><p></p><h2>Is Shiva a Hindu god?</h2>Shiva, (Sanskrit: “Auspicious One”) also spelled Śiwa or Śiva, one of the main deities of Hinduism, whom Shaivites worship as the supreme god. Among his common epithets are Shambhu (“Benign”), Shankara (“Beneficent”), Mahesha (“Great Lord”), and Mahadeva (“Great God”).<h2>What was Gandhi religion?</h2>Gandhi of course was born a Hindu but his interpretation of Hinduism was his own. While keeping firm roots in ancient Hinduism, he welcomed contact with other religions, especially the Christian doctrines.<h2>Are Hindu gods real?</h2>While there are diverse deities in Hinduism, states Lawrence, "Exclusivism – which maintains that only one's own deity is real" is rare in Hinduism.<h2>Is Krishna real?</h2>According to Guy Beck, "most scholars of Hinduism and Indian history accept the historicity of Krishna – that he was a real male person, whether human or divine, who lived on Indian soil by at least 1000 BCE and interacted with many other historical persons within the cycles of the epic and puranic histories."<h2>Which God is still alive?</h2>The above lines mean that by daily remembering these 8 immortals (Ashwatthama, King Mahabali, Vedvyasa, Hanuman, Vibhishana, Kripacharya, Parashurama and Rishi Markandaya) one can be free of all ailments and live for more than 100 years.<h2>Can Hindu read Bible?</h2>No need for religious conversions in India as Hindus are free to read Quran or Bible, says Uma Bharti.<h2>Which is the purest religion?</h2>Hinduism. According to the principle scripture of Hinduism, the Bhagavad-gītā, truth is Krishna himself. This is confirmed by Vyasa as stated in the verse, You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the ultimate abode, the purest, the Absolute Truth.<h2>Who founded Hinduism?</h2>Unlike other religions, Hinduism has no one founder but is instead a fusion of various beliefs. Around 1500 B.C., the Indo-Aryan people migrated to the Indus Valley, and their language and culture blended with that of the indigenous people living in the region.<h2>Can you leave Hinduism?</h2>To leave Hinduism is complicated by the close connection between Hindu religiosity and forms of Indian sociocultural identity. This makes the issue of conversion such a controversial subject, as leaving one's religion can be considered as a form of ethno-apostasy.<h2>Is Shiva an evil god?</h2>Shiva is therefore seen as the source of both good and evil and is regarded as the one who combines many contradictory elements. Shiva is known to have untamed passion, which leads him to extremes in behaviour.<h2>Is Shiva male or female?</h2>In Vaishnavism and Shaivism, God, Vishnu or Shiva respectively, is personified as male. God, however, transcends gender in these sub-schools, and the male form is used as an icon to help focus the Puja (worship). The use of icons is not restricted to male forms.<h2>Who is the first god in the world?</h2>Brahma the Creator<p>In the beginning, Brahma sprang from the cosmic golden egg and he then created good & evil and light & dark from his own person. He also created the four types: gods, demons, ancestors, and men (the first being Manu).</p><h2>Which religion is first in world?</h2>Hinduism (founded around the 15th – 5th century BCE)<p>The first and foremost of these is a belief in the Vedas – four texts compiled between the 15th and 5th centuries BCE on the Indian subcontinent, and the faith's oldest scriptures – which make Hinduism without doubt the oldest religion in existence.</p><h2>Is India a Hindu country?</h2>Hinduism is the largest religion in India. According to the 2011 Census of India, 966.3 Million people identify as Hindu, representing 79.8% of the country's population. India contains 94% of the global Hindu population.<h2>What is the oldest religion?</h2>It is the world's third-largest religion, with over 1.2 billion followers, or 15–16% of the global population, known as Hindus. The word Hindu is an exonym, and while Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world, many practitioners refer to their religion as Sanātana Dharma (Sanskrit: सनातन धर्म, lit.<h2>How can I become a Hindu?</h2>There is no official conversion process or ceremony for converting to the Hindu faith. To become a follower, one needs only to have the will and the commitment to study the scriptures and abide the proper practices.<h2>Do Hindus believe sin?</h2>With the Hindu, speaking generally, religion is not grounded in the sense of the need of deliverance from sin; and in this respect the Hindu point of view is widely removed from the Christian.

Sin means to him essentially rebellion against God.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahpmaho2K1qrrDrmSgp5So</p></div><div id=links><a href=./charlie-lenehan.html>&#171;&nbsp;Charlie Lenehan Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a>
